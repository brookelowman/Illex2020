# Illex2020

This repository contains R scripts to build and run a VAST model for Illex illecebrosus in the Northwest Atlantic. 
Support files include scripts for data wrangling and to build a custom extrapolation grid for use in VAST. Publicly available and non-confidential data can be found in the data folder. Some helpful resources for using VAST are included. For further information, visit the [VAST repository](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST).
